# robotics

[Summer 2020] I constructed a mobile robot, adapted from a kit by Osoyoo. The robot contained multiple infrared sensors as well as a ultrasonic sensor. 

The mobile robot is able to perform three tasks: line following, wall following, and parallel parking. A neat way to get into autonomous vehicle development :)
